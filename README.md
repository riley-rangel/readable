# Readable Project (Udacity React Nanodegree)

This is a project for the final assessment of Udacity's Redux course. Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

The backend server was included as part of the starter template cloned from https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter.

## API Server

Information about the API server and how to use it can be found in its [README file](api-server/README.md).
